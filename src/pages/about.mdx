## Brief introduction

At some point I will decide to make a timeline here. Or maybe I will decide to delete it

## TimeLine

    <TimeLine

items={[
{ year: "2024-8-4", event: "I decided that I would hike the AT in 2027" },
{ year: "2025-3-7", event: "First shakedown hike at Lake Vesuvius Backpacker Trail" },
]}
/>

  </BaseCard>
</BaseLayout>
